=============

Casanova Flow is a (prototype) visual language made for the Casanova framework a 
language for game development implemented in F#. With the visual language we 
attempt to generate syntax and semantics from visual structures.

The language is visualized with the assitance of an editor that was made on top of 
the windows presentation foundation, the visual structures are generic, but with help
of wpf those can be iterated on in future development.
